Studies in Artificial Intelligence have grown and diversified in different applications, and often associated with robotics, increasingly requiring trained professionals for its use and exploration in different environments. Because of this need, open robotics platforms can be a potential solution for introductory learning in these two areas. Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop an open source platform based on the models used in the Micromouse competition. This platform will consist of a prototype, a simulation environment and a test maze. A methodology divided into four parts was used: conceptual, design, development and conclusion. The phases of this methodology generated materials that culminated in the elaboration of two prototypes with assembly and configuration guides, a simulation environment using ROS and Gazebo, a modular maze proposal and a robot control software package. Finally, it is presented at the end of the work the conclusions obtained, possible approaches to use the platform and future work.
